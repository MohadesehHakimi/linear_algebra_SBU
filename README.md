# Linear Algebra Course – SBU

This repository contains my programming assignments and solutions for the Linear Algebra course at SBU.  

All algorithms were implemented from scratch without using high-level library functions, to better understand the underlying mathematics and computations.  

The assignments cover key topics in linear algebra and their computational applications, including:  
- Vector spaces and linear independence  
- Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization  
- Span of vectors  
- Solving systems of equations using Cramer’s rule and inverse matrices  
- Row echelon form and matrix rank  
- Eigenvectors via power iteration  
- LU decomposition  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
